<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If you enjoy curried anything, youâ€™re going to
    love bobotie. The aromatic meat filling, combined
    with the very thin, bay leaf-infused custard on top,
    makes this an easy, gorgeous, and extremely
    delicious one-pan meal.</p>

    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>5 teaspoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>4 bay laurel leaves, divided</li>
    <li>1 rounded tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1/3 cup Indian-style fruit chutney, or to taste</li>
    <li>3 slices white bread, crusts removed</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups milk, divided</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat olive oil and butter in a large oven-proof
        skillet over medium heat. Add onions and salt,
        and cook until just beginning to soften and turn
        translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in curry powder, cumin, turmeric, black pepper,
        and oregano, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add ground beef, and cook, stirring, while breaking
        the meat up into small crumbles. Add 1 bay leaf,
        tomato paste, and garlic, and cook, stirring,
        for another 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in lemon juice and zest, vinegar, Worcestershire,
        and chutney. Smooth the top, and simmer mixture gently
        for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, add bread to a bowl and cover with
        1/2 cup of milk, toss, and let stand for 5 minutes.
        Squeeze excess milk back into the bowl
        and add soaked bread to meat. Mash, smash
        and stir mixture until bread is thoroughly blended in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add remaining 1 cup milk to the bowl; add eggs,
        cayenne, and pinch of salt, and whisk thoroughly.
        Pour gently over meat, and top with 3 or more
        bay leaves.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until custard
        on top is set and lightly golden brown, about 45 minutes.
        Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
    </li>
