<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This dessert is known by many people who have

    or even if you just wanted to surprise someone.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
    <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    <li>½ cup orange juice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons orange zest</li>
    <li>3 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin</li>
    <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>½ cup cold water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¾ cup chopped pistachio nuts</li>
    <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Bring 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, and corn syrup
        to a boil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan.
        Cook, stirring frequently, until the temperature
        reaches 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) on a candy
        thermometer. Set aside and keep hot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir together orange juice and orange zest,
        sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside. In a small bowl,
        dissolve cornstarch in 1/2 cup cold water,
        then stir into hot syrup. Place over medium-low heat,
        and simmer, stirring gently, until very thick.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove syrup from heat, stir in orange juice mixture,
        vanilla, and pistachios. Sprinkle a 8x8-inch pan
        generously with confectioners' sugar. Pour the
        Turkish delight into the pan, and let cool in a cool,
        dry place (not the refrigerator) until set, 3 to 4 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        When cool, sprinkle the top with another thick
        layer of powdered sugar. Cut into 1-inch squares,
        and dredge each well with confectioners' sugar.
        Store at room temperature in an airtight container.
    </li>
